							Hi, today I want to show you my idea of a new protocol, for which
							I look for partners. A handful should already be enough. My name
							is Armin, but on the net you can find me under the nick <a
							href="https://twitter.com/bebna">bebna</a>, but let us come back
							to the topic:
						</p>
						<h2>The Problem</h2>
						<p>
							Today, Twitter is on the most important ways of communication, but
							is it central and under closed development. Which makes it a
							ticking bomb for me. Especially after the owner decided to give
							it's own client advantages over other alternative client
							implementations.
						</p>
						<h2>The Solution</h2>
						<p>
							A open and decentral protocol will provide a good fundation for
							the future of short message communication and micro blogging.
							<br />
							Those type of protocols are today not something unknown or hard,
							there are already known and proven implemenations:
							<ul>
								<li>Bittorrent</li>
								<li>Bitcoin</li>
								<li>Tor</li>
								<li>...</li>
							</ul>
						</p>
						<h2>The Rough Requirements</h2>
						<p>
							But unfortunately these protocols don't fit or target the needs a
							short message or micro blogging service has to provide. The
							creation of posts or messages has to be easy and natural to the
							user, there is a need for public and private distribution, those
							messages have short life time and will be read or written by
							mostly mobile and often multiple devices from the same user.
						</p>
						<h2>The Way To Go</h2>
						<p>
							But thanks to the already known implemenations, one only has to pick
							the needed parts and get them to work together in a harmonic way.
							<br />
							This makes it easy to imagine the resulting work and protocol;
							there a part of Bittorrent for distributed metadata, here
							somethings from Bitcoin and so on.
						</p>
						<h2>Things To Do</h2>
						<p>
							In the end all what we have to do is identifieng the features we
							ant to implement, pick the parts needed and merge them together in
							a to be published protocol.
							<br />
							In the end, I could do this on my own, but would this be a real
							protocol then? I think not. Thats why I'm inviting you to this
							project and look forward to your comments!
						</p>
